# Car price prediction


## Problem Statement

Suppose that we have a website where people can sell and buy used cars. When posting
an ad on our website, the sellers often struggle to come up with a meaningful price. We want
to help our users with automatic price recommendation. We ask the sellers to specify model,
make, year, mileage, and other important characteristics of a car, and based on that
information, we want to suggest the best price.


### The plan for the project is the following:

1. First, we download the dataset.
2. Next, we do some preliminary analysis of the data.
3. After that, we set up a validation strategy to make sure our model produces correct
predictions.
4. Then we implement a linear regression model in Python and NumPy.
5. Next, we cover feature engineering - to extract important features from the data to
improve the model
6. Finally, we see how to make our model stable with regularization and use it to predict
car prices.
